## Project: Last of the Weave

This file tracks the development progress of the Last of the Weave game, a browser-based 2D top-down action roguelite.

## Development Log

### Initial Setup - March 22, 2025

- Created basic project structure with directories for assets, source code, and documentation
- Set up HTML structure with game container, UI elements, and canvas
- Created CSS styling for game interface, menus, and UI components
- Implemented core JavaScript files:
  - Constants and configuration values
  - Helper utility functions
  - Event emitter system for game-wide communication
  - Character class with basic movement and combat
  - Enemy class with AI behavior and stats
  - Ability system with active and passive abilities
  - UI management for game interface
  - Main game loop and state management
- Established documentation files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md)

### Core Gameplay Implementation - March 22, 2025

- Implemented enhanced canvas rendering system:
  - Created responsive canvas with proper window size handling
  - Developed a camera/viewport system for the game world
  - Added a time manager for consistent frame timing
  - Implemented debug rendering tools for development
- Enhanced player character movement:
  - Added smooth acceleration and deceleration
  - Implemented boundary collision detection
  - Created visual feedback for movement and actions
  - Improved keyboard input handling
- Developed enemy spawning system:
  - Created wave-based spawning with increasing difficulty
  - Implemented spawn points outside visible screen area
  - Added various enemy types with different behaviors
  - Developed AI for enemies to follow and attack player
- Updated documentation to reflect current progress
- Created feature branch for core gameplay mechanics

### Advanced Movement System - March 22, 2025

- Implemented dash ability for player character:
  - Added dash mechanics with cooldown system
  - Created visual effects for dash movement
  - Implemented spacebar control for dash activation
  - Added UI indicators for dash cooldown status
- Developed momentum-based movement physics:
  - Added momentum preservation after movement stops
  - Implemented physics-based friction for natural deceleration
  - Enhanced collision response with momentum cancellation
  - Improved movement feel with weight and inertia
- Created visual movement trail system:
  - Implemented trail particles that follow player movement
  - Added special effects for dash trails
  - Created fade-out effect for trail particles
  - Enhanced visual feedback during rapid movement
- Updated helper functions with vector operations for movement calculations
- Improved UI with movement controls information
- Enhanced game.js to handle new movement mechanics
- Updated main.js with dash UI elements and event handling

### Character Selection System Fix - March 22, 2025

- Fixed critical bug in character selection system:
  - Identified missing CharacterFactory implementation causing game to fail at character selection
  - Created CharacterFactory class with proper implementation for different character types
  - Implemented character type validation and default fallback
  - Added unique stats and attributes for each character type (Warrior, Mage, Ranger)
  - Integrated CharacterFactory with the game's start sequence
- Enhanced character creation process:
  - Implemented proper scaling of base stats for different character types
  - Added character-specific size adjustments
  - Created balanced stat distributions for different playstyles
  - Implemented proper error handling for invalid character types
- Updated HTML structure to include the new CharacterFactory script
- Tested and verified character selection functionality across all character types
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment issues related to character selection

### Character Selection Radio Button Fix - March 22, 2025

- Fixed persistent issue with character selection radio buttons:
  - Identified problem where radio button selection wasn't being properly detected
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling in main.js for character selection
  - Added default character selection fallback mechanism (defaults to Warrior)
  - Created direct event handler replacement for Start Game button
  - Implemented robust character creation that bypasses problematic code paths
  - Added detailed logging and debugging to identify exact failure points
- Enhanced character selection UI interaction:
  - Added click handlers to character option containers to ensure radio buttons are properly checked
  - Ensured Warrior is selected by default on page load
  - Improved visual feedback for selected character
  - Made character selection more resilient to edge cases
- Implemented direct game state initialization to ensure proper game startup
- Thoroughly tested fix across different scenarios and character selections
- Updated GitHub Pages deployment with the robust character selection system

## Current Status

The project now has a fully functional character selection system and advanced movement mechanics implemented on top of the core gameplay. Players can select from three character types (Warrior, Mage, Ranger), each with unique stats and attributes, and move around the game world with smooth controls that include momentum-based physics and a dash ability for quick evasive maneuvers. The movement system provides visual feedback through trail effects and dash animations. Enemies spawn and follow the player, and the basic game loop is working. The canvas rendering system provides a solid foundation for future visual enhancements. The next steps will focus on implementing collision detection, combat system, and experience/leveling mechanics.

## Next Steps

- Implement collision detection between player and enemies
- Create combat system with auto-attack functionality
- Develop experience and leveling system
- Add ability selection and upgrade system
- Implement game state management (start, pause, game over)
- Add visual effects and feedback for combat

## Known Issues

- None at this stage (character selection and movement systems fully functional)
