## Development Log

### Initial Setup - March 22, 2025

## Current Status

The project now has functional core gameplay mechanics implemented. Players can move around the game world with smooth controls, enemies spawn and follow the player, and the basic game loop is working. The canvas rendering system provides a solid foundation for future visual enhancements. The next steps will focus on implementing collision detection, combat system, and experience/leveling mechanics.

## Next Steps
